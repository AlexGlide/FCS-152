# FCS-152 KDU

The KDU is a small, flat remote radio interface that communicates with
the radio over serial and allows for full control of the radio. This
allows the user to relocate the radio to their back or side and still
allow full configuration without having to move the radio itself.

The KDU is not compatible with other PRC-152 clones.

It looks like this project was built with uVision/Keil software. I've
never used that but I guess 'eventually' or 'later''s as good a time
as any.
